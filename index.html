            <p id="game_play">Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a two player game where the players take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line is the winner. If all the boxes are filled before either of the players makes a line with their symbol, then it is considered to be a tie.</p>
